# pygments-xoria256

A color scheme for [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) based on
[xoria256](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2140) with some of
my own modifications to the theme. See the Pygments
[styles](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/) page for how to use it. I was able
to drop it in the `pygments/styles` directory and use it via
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).

I created the theme from copying `monokai.py` and making changes in the code
samples I was using until they looked right. It was helpful to also colorize
using Pygment classes in the HTML so that I could know which values to change.
It is no doubt incomplete, but it looked right for the examples I was trying.
